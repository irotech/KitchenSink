class Calculator():
    '''A class to mimic a simple calculator which performs addition,
       subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
       Each operation may take one or two argumentsâ€“for one argument,
       the operation should be performed on the running total. For two
       arguments, the operation should be performed on the two arguments
       to create a new running total.

       For example, add(2, 5) would produce 7 and if that were followed
       by mult(3), a value of 21 would be returned (= 7 x 3).

       The ac ("all clear") function should set the running total to 0.          
    '''

    def __init__(self):
        '''Initialize running total to 0. We could of course invoke the
           ac() function here, especially if initialization were more
           involved than simply setting the running total to 0.
