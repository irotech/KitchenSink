class Calculator():
    '''A class to mimic a simple calculator which performs addition,
       subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
       Each operation may take one or two arguments–for one argument,
       the operation should be performed on the running total. For two
       arguments, the operation should be performed on the two arguments
       to create a new running total.

       For example, add(2, 5) would produce 7 and if that were followed
       by mult(3), a value of 21 would be returned (= 7 x 3).

       The ac ("all clear") function should set the running total to 0.          
    '''

    def __init__(self):
        '''Initialize running total to 0. We could of course invoke the
           ac() function here, especially if initialization were more
           involved than simply setting the running total to 0.
